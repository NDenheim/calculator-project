Welcome to my calculator!

If using on a mobile this calculator will be in its basic form, using simple operators.

If you are viewing this on a desktop, you will be able to access a few extra functions such as trig and raising to a power!

A few things to note:

1. The trig functions and root buttons need you to type the number you wish to calculate on first then the relevant button.

e.g. Type 9, then click the square root button, then 3 will appear in the answer field.

2. Clicking on the 'Ans' button allows you to use the answer from your previous calculation.
